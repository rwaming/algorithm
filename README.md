A solution which estimates when tomatoes ripen.

#### Description
- There are raw or ripe tomatoes in a warehouse having columns and rows of a tomato farm.</br>
- a ripe tomato can ripen one to four tomatoes lying on top, bottom, left, right sides of those in one day.</br>
- But, if there are nothing on four sides of a ripe tomato, nothing happens.

#### Condition
The number of columns : M</br>
The number of rows : N

no tomato : -1</br>
raw tomato : 0</br>
ripe tomato : 1

2 <= M,N <= 1,000

1 <= tomato

#### Output
- If all tomatoes are ripened, print the number of days which it takes to ripen all tomatoes.
- If all tomatoes are already ripened when you gave, print 0.
- If there are raw tomatoes in a warehouse, print -1.
