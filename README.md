A solution which estimates when tomatoes ripen.

#### Description
- There are raw or ripe tomatoes in a warehouse having columns and rows of a tomato farm.<br>
- a ripe tomato can ripen one to four tomatoes lying on top, bottom, left, right sides of those in one day.<br>
- But, if there are nothing on four sides of a ripe tomato, nothing happens.

#### Condition
The number of columns : M<br>
The number of rows : N

No tomato : -1<br>
Raw tomato : 0<br>
Ripe tomato : 1

2 <= M,N <= 1,000

1 <= tomato

#### Output
- **All tomatoes are ripened**<br>
: the number of days which it takes to ripen all tomatoes
- **All tomatoes are already ripened when you gave**<br>
: 0
- **There are raw tomatoes in a warehouse**<br>
: -1
